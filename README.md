# skillmodels

## Introduction

Welcome to skillmodels, a Python implementation of estimators for skill formation
models. The econometrics of skill formation models is a very active field and several
estimators were proposed. None of them is implemented in standard econometrics packages.

## Installation

The package can be installed via conda. To do so, type the following in a terminal:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install skillmodels
```

## Documentation

[The documentation is hosted at readthedocs](https://skillmodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Alternatively, you can build it locally. After cloning the repository you can cd to the
docs directory and type:

```
make html
```

## Citation

It took countless hours to write skillmodels. I make it available under a very
permissive license in the hope that it helps other people to do great research that
advances our knowledge about the formation of cognitive and noncognitive siklls. If you
find skillmodels helpful, please don't forget to cite it. Below you can find the bibtex
entry for a suggested citation. The suggested citation will be updated once the code
becomes part of a published paper.
